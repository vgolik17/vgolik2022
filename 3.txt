Fans of Tesla Motors (TSLA) (and I know there are a few) had some reason to cheer today, with Alan Ohnsman at Bloomberg reporting that the company's Model S car overtookGeneral Motors' (GM) Chevrolet Volt to become the best-selling electric car in the U.S. and Canada in March:
Tesla expects to report at least 4,750 deliveries of the electric Model S in the U.S. and Canada when it releases first-quarter results on May 8, said Shanna Hendriks, a company spokeswoman, reiterating a March 31 estimate. That compares with 4,421 Volt sales in North America and 3,695 deliveries of Nissan Motor's Leaf, based on data provided by the carmakers.
The sales ranking for Model S is a first for the Palo Alto, California-based company's flagship model and coincides with Tesla saying it would report a first-quarter profit, the first in its 10-year history. The plug-in hybrid Volt, which uses both batteries and a gasoline engine, led regional sales in 2012.
Then again, maybe it's too soon for Tesla's supporters to break out the bubbly:
While Tesla's quarterly lead is "interesting trivia," Volt will see higher volume over time, said John Wolkonowicz, an independent auto analyst based in Boston.
"The Volt is the one that makes sense out of that whole group of plug-ins, because you can use it like a regular car when the battery runs out," Wolkonowicz said.
Tesla's small size, relative to GM and Nissan, will keep the electric-car maker under financial pressure, he said.
So there.
Shares of Tesla are down 0.3% Friday but have gained 8.4% this week; GM is down 2% today but still up 3.3% for the week.
