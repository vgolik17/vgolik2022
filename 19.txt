As the car market anticipates the arrival of the Tesla Model S electric-powered sedan next year, new information about the car continues on trickle forth. According to numerous reports Tesla boss Elon Musk said at a weekend event the company will also sell a higher-performance version of the car.

The souped-up Model S  reportedly will accelerate to 60 mph from a standstill in 4.5 seconds, which is two-tenths of a second quicker than the 2011 Porsche 911 Carrera with a manual transmission. If you order the Porsche with the company's quick-shifting PDK automatic it will match the Tesla at 4.5 seconds in the zero-to-60 sprint.

There are versions of the 911 including the Carrera S, GT3 and Turbo that will could more easily outrun the Tesla. But what is important is that the big sedan will be able to run with the Porsche, Chevrolet Corvette, Audi R8 and other muscular sports cars. It would also establish electric power as a performance feature, not just a gasoline-saving one. Even the basic Model S is quick at 5.6 seconds from zero to 60.

The car is to roll out next year as a 2013 model with prices starting at $50,000. Tesla says the S will have a range of up to 300 miles, depending on which battery option the buyer chooses. The company could not be reached immediately for comment.
