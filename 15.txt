Did you catch that Tesla stock? It is understandable if you missed it. The electric-car maker's shares have been moving so fast in so many different directions, it is hard to keep track.


Tesla made its debut as a public company on Tuesday with its shares trading at $19. By the end of trading Wednesday, Tesla shares had zoomed to $29.90, a 57% increase in just two trading days.

Thursday, Tesla's shares went into a nose dive. This afternoon, the shares were at $19.15, on track for a complete round-trip in just three days.

In many ways, Tesla's wild ride is a condensed version of the convulsions in the broader stock market in the past few months. Investors in the electric car company seem to fear what investors in the market fear generally about the economy: that the emperor has no clothes.

The year began with great hopes for the economic recovery as the banking system, housing market and manufacturing sectors showed signs the worst was behind them. But a string of anemic jobs reports have investors worried that the recovery was only skin deep, propped up by government stimulus money. The Dow is down roughly 7% year to date and about 30% from its high for the year in April.

Likewise, Tesla launched its IPO with great fanfare on Tuesday. The start-up company offered the wave of the future: a hip (and fast) electric car.

The problem is that the company has failed to turn a profit since it started in 2003 and it too has relied on government help in the form of (a roughly $400 million grant for green businesses). The only car that it sells, the high-end roadster retails for about $109,000, which could have trouble selling in a double dip recession.

Now, if Tesla's cars can move as fast as its stock, the company will have brighter days ahead.
