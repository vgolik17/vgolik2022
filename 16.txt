DETROIT–Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA 5.78%▲ will deliver two electric-car prototypes based on existing Toyota Motor models this month, the first evidence of the cooperation between the start-up and the world's largest car maker.

Toyota, which purchased roughly 3% of Tesla last month after its initial public offering, is working with the Palo Alto, Calif.-based car maker to develop an electric car.

"Since our announcement in May, Toyota and Tesla engineering teams have made a lot of progress in a short amount of time, and it is exciting to start seeing some initial results," said Tesla's chief technical officer, J.B. Straubel, in a prepared statement.

Toyota and Tesla have now signed a joint vehicle-development agreement, solidifying the verbal agreement made at a joint press conference in May, said Ricardo Reyes, a Tesla spokesman. The partnership will combine a high-volume Toyota vehicle with a Tesla electric powertrain. Mr. Reyes wouldn't say which Toyota vehicle or vehicles they are working on.

The first driving prototype has already been built and is undergoing testing. It will be unveiled to the public later this year, Mr. Reyes said.

Toyota President Akio Toyoda told The Wall Street Journal last week that Tesla's use of low-cost, small batteries to power its $109,000 Roadster sports car is intriguing because it has potential to lower costs of manufacturing and complexity. Toyota's own electric vehicle program uses much larger batteries.
