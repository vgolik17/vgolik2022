Following the announcement this morning by Tesla (TSLA) that it has made enhancements to its "Roadster" model of electric car that will improve driving range, Trip Chowdhry with Global Equities Research reiterated an Overweight rating on Tesla stock, and a $385 price target, writing that this is a "catalyst" for the stock that he's been anticipating.
Tesla shares ar up $5.61, or 2.5%, at $227.87.
Tesla said three things could be retrofitted to the Tesla Roadster to improving its driving range to 400 miles on a single battery charge, and promising to demonstrate in early 2015 via a Los Angeles to San Francisco drive. Those improvements are a new lithium-ion battery, inside the existing battery package, with improved fuel-cell technology; a new "aero kit" that reduces drag on the car; and new kinds of tires.
"There is a set of speeds and driving conditions where we can confidently drive the Roadster 3.0 over 400 miles," the company said in its announcement, referring to the set of enhancements.
There are only 2,400 Roadsters sold from 2008 to 2012, writes Chowdhry, without citing sources. The current distance per charge is 244 miles. The improvement to 400 miles, 63%, coming six years after its debut, would be "phenomenal," he writes.
Although Tesla said in its announcement that no upgrade is imminent for the mainstream "Model S" sedan, Chowdhry opines that "We expect TSLA Model S to have 500 mile range probably by 2017 - 2018; and all the existing Model S, could be retrofitted with the new Battery Packs, when available."

Chowdhry's "key takeaway" from the announcement: "TSLA is probably the only Technology company to retrofit an older generation product with the latest technology."
More to the point, for the stock, Chowdhry refers back to a September note he put out, following his attendance at an industry conference, Refuel, in which note he listed 400-mile driving range as a catalyst for the stock.
