Eurozone Recovery Picks Up Speed but Ukraine War Threatens Deep Contractions

Economic growth in the eurozone accelerated even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy and food costs surging and shattered household and business confidence, but cuts to supplies of natural gas threaten to push it into contraction over coming months.

The world’s third-largest economy was buoyed by the lifting of most pandemic restrictions during the first half of the year, which helped it grow at a faster-than-expected clip despite higher energy costs and continued blockages in supply chains.

The European Union’s statistics agency Friday said the combined gross domestic product of the eurozone’s members was 0.7% higher in the three months through June than in the first quarter, and 4% higher than a year earlier. That was a faster rate of growth than the 0.1% expansion forecast by economists who were surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week, and equivalent to an annualized growth rate of 2.8%, compared with a 2.0% rate recorded in the first quarter.

While Germany’s economy stagnated, a return to growth in France after a first-quarter contraction was driven by international tourists. The Italian and Spanish economies both grew at a faster pace during the quarter.

By contrast, figures released Thursday showed the U.S. economy shrank at an annualized rate of 0.9% in the three months through June. With China’s GDP having also fallen from the previous quarter, the eurozone was the most significant part of the global economy to avoid a contraction.

That is unlikely to be true in the coming quarters. Business surveys for July suggest the eurozone is already experiencing a decline in economic activity. Russia on Wednesday cut its supplies of natural gas to levels that will make it challenging for the eurozone to get through the winter without some form of energy rationing. The EU has responded with a plan to cut consumption to build reserves.

Businesses that rely on natural gas as an energy source or a raw material are already preparing for that possibility. German chemicals giant BASF SE uses a lot of gas at its main Ludwigshafen site, but Chief Executive Martin Brudermüller said he believes it would still be able to operate “at a reduced load” even if gas supplies were halved.

“We are optimistic we can get through this,” Mr. Brudermüller said Wednesday in a briefing on the company’s second-quarter results. “We are in crisis mode, but we are not panicking.”

However, BASF’s ability to continue production under rationing would depend on the government deciding that its products are essential. Businesses that don’t meet that test would have lower access to gas supplies.

Economists at UBS estimate that energy rationing forced upon the eurozone by Russian cuts to supply would push the currency area’s economy into deep contractions during the third and fourth quarters, as well as the first quarter of next year.

“It could easily get worse,” said Reinhard Cluse, an economist at UBS.

They also estimate that higher energy prices would push the annual rate of inflation to 11.2% in the final three months of this year. Separate figures released by Eurostat on Friday showed the annual rate of inflation rose to a fresh record of 8.9% in July, from 8.6% in June.

As in the U.S., the eurozone’s jobs market has been strong over recent months, with the unemployment rate at 6.6% in June, the lowest level since records began in 1998. Recent surveys indicate that businesses are cutting back on their hiring plans, but with vacancies at record highs, a surge in unemployment is unlikely even if the economy contracts.

“Labor shortages seem widespread and are likely to make firms reluctant to lay off staff, using the workweek to absorb the shock, provided the recession is mild and short-lived,” economists at JPMorgan wrote in a note to clients.


The possibility of energy rationing over winter months has already weakened consumer confidence in the eurozone, with the European Commission’s monthly measure of sentiment hitting its lowest level on record in July. Mounting pessimism has made consumers more reluctant to spend, particularly on more expensive items whose purchase can be delayed.

“Not only do they not know how costly energy will be during the winter but, even for those who would be able to pay, it is far from certain whether enough energy will be available,” said Daniela Ordonez, an economist at Oxford Economics. “As a result, households are facing unprecedented uncertainty.”

The European Central Bank is another potential threat to growth. Its plans for gradual increases in its key interest rate during 2023 have been upended by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and last week it announced a surprisingly large rise to zero from minus 0.5%.

But with the eurozone economy set to slow sharply as a result of the war, some economists worry that the ECB’s efforts to demonstrate its determination to get inflation down to its target could push the economy into a deep contraction.

“We are now on a fast track toward 1.0%-2.0%,” wrote Erik F. Nielsen, an economist at UniCredit, in a note to clients. “Yet, this intended trajectory will either have to be abandoned, with potential risk to the ECB’s reputation, or the ECB will cause serious damage to growth in 2023-24.”
