Tesla may be switching to a higher gear.
At least one analyst thinks Tesla Motors ’ fourth-quarter deliveries, likely to be announced next week, will be a positive. Trip Chowdhry at Global Equities Research said in a note Tuesday that Tesla has likely delivered more than 18,300 cars since Sept. 30. That would be higher than the midpoint of Tesla’s guidance, which called for 17,000 to 19,000 deliveries.
And it would be significantly higher than delivery totals in the past three quarters. This raises a risk that extra deliveries could cause the average vehicle selling price to fall, although Mr. Chowdhry believes this remained stable in the fourth quarter.
What remains to be seen: whether improved sales will translate to better cash flow. Tesla posted free cash flow of negative $1.7 billion in 2015’s first nine months. And cash burn has worsened as the pace of deliveries quickened.
Sometimes going faster doesn’t get you where you need to be.
